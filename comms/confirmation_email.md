**Thank you for taking the NGO-ISAC Organizational Baseline Security Maturity Assessment.** Please see below for your results and some guidance on how to use your score to prioritize your next steps.

## Understanding Your Score
**This is not a test and there are no wrong answers.** The scores in this test are designed to help you prioritize next steps, track your progress, and make a stronger case for the time, budget, and leadership (or donor) support needed to keep pace with changing risks.

When deciding which assessment Objectives to tackle first, prioritize either: 1) low-scoring Objectives where you already have strong relationships, influence, or active projects in your organization that can help you build momentum with near-term wins; or 2) Objectives where you regularly answered "I don't know," which signals low visibility and a need to improve understanding. These blind spots often conceal meaningful opportunities for improvement.

If you’re struggling to achieve certain high-priority Objectives or Outcomes, consider shifting focus to earlier Sections first. The Sections are designed to build on one another: strengthening foundational Objectives in earlier Sections typically makes later Objectives and Outcomes easier to complete and improves overall results.

*Note on "Total" scores:* When we calculate your total score, “I don’t know” and “I don’t understand” responses are counted as 0 points.
