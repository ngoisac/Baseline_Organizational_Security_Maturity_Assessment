# Organizational Security Assessment Survey

## About
This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie.

This survey is a fork of the [Organizational Security Assessment Tool COVID-19 Edition](https://0xacab.org/iecology/orgsec-assessment/) and the [Digital Security Readiness Assessment Tool](https://0xacab.org/iecology/security-checklists) created by Jonah Silas Sheridan, Lisa Jervis for [Information Ecology](https://iecology.org/).

## Maturity Scores
Maturity scores are based on the standard Capability Maturity Model (CMM) scales (Initial, Managed, Defined, Measured (Quantitatively Managed), and Optimizing) (See: [CMMI Inssitute Maturity Levels](https://cmmiinstitute.com/learning/appraisals/levels))

#### Maturity Level 0: Incomplete
Ad hoc and unknown. Work may or may not get completed.

#### Maturity Level 1: Initial
Unpredictable and reactive. Work gets completed but is often delayed and over budget.

#### Maturity Level 2: Managed
Managed on the project level. Projects are planned, performed, measured, and controlled.

#### Maturity Level 3: Defined
Proactive, rather than reactive. Organization-wide standards provide guidance across projects, programs, and portfolios.

#### Maturity Level 4: Quantitatively Managed
Measured and controlled. Organization is data-driven with quantitative performance improvement objectives that are predictable and align to meet the needs of internal and external stakeholders.

#### Maturity Level 5: Optimizing
Stable and flexible. Organization is focused on continuous improvement and is built to pivot and respond to opportunity and change. The organization’s stability provides a platform for agility and innovation.
