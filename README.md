# Organizational Security Assessment Survey

## About
This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie.

This survey is a fork of the [Organizational Security Assessment Tool COVID-19 Edition](https://0xacab.org/iecology/orgsec-assessment/) and the [Digital Security Readiness Assessment Tool](https://0xacab.org/iecology/security-checklists) created by Jonah Silas Sheridan, Lisa Jervis for [Information Ecology](https://iecology.org/).

## Outcome Scores

Outcome Scores are a series of "outcome" based statements which, when added together, show the organizations ability to achieve each Maturity Objective.

Objectives are composed of two types of outcome statements. "BASELINE," outcome statements that show that the short-term baseline functionality has been accomplished. "CARE," outcome statements that reflect an organizations commitment to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and others.

### Care Outcomes Themes
"CARE," outcome statements reflect an organizations commitment to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and others. These statements, generally speaking, reflect one or more of the following areas of safety/well-being.

#### Security Collaboration
WHAT: Is the organization effectively utilizing security collaboration with other organizations and groups who have similar contexts, processes, technologies, and/or goals. Security collaboration is when group(s) of organizations act together to achieve common objectives or address shared challenges. Some examples of what this may look like include sharing information on relevant incidents and risks, pooling resources, expertise, and efforts to achieve common objectives or address shared challenges,  and/or developing individual and collective security plans which protect critical shared infrastructure (people, efforts, technologies, or organizations) whose disruption would cause significant damage to the ability for group member's to operate or achieve their missions.

WHY: Effective security collaboration acts as a capacity multiplier for organizations of all sizes. The ability to share and collaboratively develop security information and support is especially critical for smaller organizations as they can allow them to overcome common operational and resource challenges without needing to develop large formal internal technology and security structures.

#### Holistic Risk Management
WHAT: The organization takes a holistic approach to risk management that integrates the management of safety, security, well-being, and operational risks (physical, digital, psycho‑social, legal, financial, reputational, and other dimensions) as part of a jointly owned and coordinated approach.

WHY: When safety, wellness, security, and operational risks are being assessed and addressed in a continuous and coordinated manner, an organization can manage risks to its mission and operations and to safeguard the safety, security, and wellbeing of all staff and other individuals affected by its activities. A holistic approach to risk management allows an organization to ensure that their risk management efforts are streamlined, strategic, agile, and resilient. Managing risks holistically optimizes resource allocation by removing redundant ad-hoc controls and increases operational efficiency by eliminating onerous security processes that impede the work and mission. Integrated approaches will not only produce a far more accurate understandings of the impacts of risks as they cascade across different domains; it exposes how the interplay of mitigation and contingency measures can have unintended negative consequences for risk-management efforts in other domains.

#### Informed Consent
WHAT: All staff, constituents, participants, and beneficiaries are informed about relevant risks, acceptable risk levels, mitigation procedures, and contingency plans if things go wrong, including their individual roles and responsibilities. And have accepted these risks after the organization has clarified both their right to withdraw and the level of risk the organization has identified as acceptable.

WHY: (TODO)
- informed consent helps ensure security controls are implemented (by staff, partners in coalition, donors, etc) by making them real and connected to reasonable threats.
- informed consent ensures that relevant stakeholders inform you of unique circumstances that change the likelihood/impact of risks or the efficacy of mitigations. (SeeL Inclusive Security)

#### Inclusive Security
WHAT: Staff, constituent, participant, and beneficiary security, safety, and wellbeing are impacted by the interplay between where they are, the work they do, who they are, and their association with the organization and its activities. Inclusive security risk management approaches look to protect those involved with their work from foreseeable risks, including those that emerge due to their personal characteristics – for example, biological sex, gender, ethnicity, socio‑economic status, cognitive and physical abilities, or sexual orientation.

WHY: Not understanding how personal profile characteristics impact personal security and well-being can have implications for the security of those individuals, the goals they are working towards, and the organization as a whole.  An individuals unique profile or circumstances can (sometimes dramatically) change the actual likelihood/impact of risks or the efficacy of identified mitigations. (For example, risk management around staff BYOD devices often only consider the employee as a user on those devices. But, parents who cannot afford a separate computer for their child regularly share their personal computers. Sharing a device with a child dramatically increases the likelihood that the device becomes infected with malware. An inclusive security approach establishes processes to identify and respond to this type of individual profile/context with appropriate mitigations.) Beyond the immediate impacts on individuals, the unidentified flaws created by not considering how the diverse profiles and contexts of key stakeholders impact the accuracy of an organizations risk management efforts can lead to serious security, legal and reputational issues for an organization.
