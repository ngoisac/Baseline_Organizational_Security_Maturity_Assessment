## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across four categories: cultural hallmarks of security success, information technology operations that support security outcomes, digital security baseline capacities, and best practices for safe working from home. Go through each section one by one.

For each item, you should grade your organization honestly on a scale from 1 to 5. At the end of the survey you will receive an email that includes your score and how to interpret it.


# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

## 1.1
### Field Label:
Have a culture of training and learning, including strong technology training and follow up as part of new staff orientation procedures.

### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Supporting Text:
New tools and practices, and changes to standard operating procedures, demand end-user training. If your organization doesn't have established practices around training--when new people are hired, when refresher training is needed, and when important processes change--implementing improved and possibly complex secure practices is nearly impossible. Beginning with documentation and training for new hires is a wise first step in this area. Following up with new employees at 30-day intervals will ensure they continue to get the support they need to do their work effectively and securely. When a new process is introduced, it is like everyone in your organization is new to it, so initial training with similar follow-up is recommended.

### Outcomes
- 0: When new staff/volunteers are hired they receive training on relevant technologies and processes.
- 1: Staff/volunteers receive refresher training on relevant technologies and processes.
- 2: Staff/volunteers receive training for new and changed technologies and processes.
- 3: Staff/volunteers are able to easily find documentation for technologies and processes they use.
- 4:
- 5:


### OLD Maturity Questions
- 0: We have no formalized training of any kind. Information about the way we do our work is passed on to staff in an ad-hoc manner as they carry out their work.
- 1:
- 2:
- 3:
- 4: We have established practices around training when new people are hired, when refresher training is needed, and when important processes change.
- 5: We have a strong learning culture with clear practices for training and re-training staff, checking their retention of key information, and continuously improving our training.

## 1.2
### Field Label:
Have a common and clearly communicated set of information systems that are administered by the organization and used with defined processes; ensure that all staff follow these processes effectively and are not using other systems for their work.

### Short Title:
Asset & Process Management
### Internal Label:
1.2

### Supporting Text:

### Outcomes
- 0: There is a common set of information systems that are administered by the organization
- 1: The organization has defined processes (TODO: Is this about systems for specific key processes; that ALL processeses are defined; or that appropriate systems are available for ALL types of work - which requires knowing the work being done. I think that last item is actually what we want.)
- 2: All staff know which information systems to use for our standardized/defined processes (TODO: if they don't have strongly defined processes or a common set of info systems then this should not count?)
- 3: The organization knows all systems and/or services being used by staff to accomplish their work.
- 4:
- 5:

SEE: (1.3 outcome 1)

### OLD Maturity Questions
- 0:
- 1:
- 2: Some key organization-wide processes and technologies have been codified. Individual teams or projects have codified the processes, systems, and services which they use. However, there is limited overall consistency or coordination across the organization.
- 3: [you know what all the processes and assets are  and/or are actively seeking out any undocumented ones]
- 4:
- 5:

## 1.3
### Field Label:
Leadership for technology and operations within your organization comes from all levels.

### Short Title:
Key Stakeholder Investment and Involvement
### Internal Label:
1.3

### Supporting Text:

### Outcomes
- 0: Staff at all levels are supported in identifying, reviewing, changing, and/or replacing processes and associated systems that they have identified as inappropriate or impediments to their work or the organizations mission.
- 1:
- 2:
- 3:
- 4:
- 5:

### OLD Maturity Questions
- 0: Technology planning, decisions, training, and support are entirely managed by technology staff.
- 1:
- 2: Individual teams or projects have identified staff technology champions for the systems and services which they use.
- 3: The organization has a group of volunteer Security Awareness Champions who receive basic training and share security tips with their colleagues.
- 4:
- 5: The organization implements a comprehensive Security Awareness Network with champions in every department, featuring regular meetings, advanced training, recognition programs, and a feedback loop that directly informs organizational technology and security strategies.

### OLD Maturity Questions
- 0:
- 1: Some policies are in place. But, critical cybersecurity functions such as risk assessment, incident response, and/or patch management are managed ad-hoc rather than through structured processes.
- 2: Policies are in place for critical systems, services, and cybersecurity functions. But, discrepancies between policies and actual practices are commonplace and/or many staff do not understand how those policies apply to them.

### Field Label:
Have a disaster recovery plan that includes making and testing regular backups of organizational data that are stored at at least two locations. Backup drives should at a minimum be stored in a physically secure location like a locking file cabinet or safety deposit box, and ideally encrypted so that only you can access them. The storage location is especially critical for keeping backups in peoples' homes and your organization should invest in resources (safes, lock boxes, etc.) to support safe storage in personal homes.  Do not rely exclusively on third parties to back up and hold your information.
