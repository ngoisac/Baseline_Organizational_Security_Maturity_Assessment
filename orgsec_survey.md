## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across four categories: cultural hallmarks of security success, information technology operations that support security outcomes, digital security baseline capacities, and best practices for safe working from home. Go through each section one by one.

For each item, you should grade your organization honestly on a scale from 1 to 5. At the end of the survey you will receive an email that includes your score and how to interpret it.
