## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across three categories: 1) cultural hallmarks of security success, 2) information technology operations that support security outcomes, 3) digital security baseline capacities. Go through each section one by one.


## Terms used in this survey
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes devices, software, hosted solutions, third-party hosted solutions, etc.
- processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- security practices: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- "Inappropriate" systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.”
- "Appropriate" systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Broader Risks: The full range of interconnected risks facing an organization and the people it serves; spanning physical, digital, psychosocial, legal, financial, reputational, operational, and other dimensions. When used in this assessment, it signals that the risks being described extend beyond pure information security risks to risks with impacts on mission effectiveness, individual safety or wellbeing, or organizational operations.

# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

## 1.1
### Field Label:
Staff have the technology and process knowledge they need to do their work effectively.
### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Supporting Text:
New tools, updated processes, and changes to how work gets done all require staff to learn something new. Without consistent, accessible training, even well-designed systems and processes fail in practice because the people using them are left to figure things out on their own. The problem compounds over time: staff who never received proper training pass on incomplete knowledge to others, workarounds become normalized, and security practices erode not because people chose to ignore them but because nobody ever showed them how to follow them correctly.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff have access to the training they need to use organizational systems and follow organizational processes effectively and securely, whether that training stays current and relevant as things change, and whether it is designed to meet staff where they are rather than applying a single approach to everyone.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff are provided training on systems and processes they are expected to use.
- X: Staff are provided refresher training on relevant topics.
- X: Staff are only required to train on the topics which are relevant to their current skill level or role.
- X: Training materials are available in multiple formats so staff can learn in a way that works best for them.
- X: Staff at all levels provide feedback which is used to refine training efforts to be more effective.
- X: Training materials are kept up to date with changes in the context, risk landscape, systems, and processes.

## 1.2
### Field Label:
Have a common and clearly communicated set of information systems that are administered by the organization and used with defined processes; ensure that all staff follow these processes effectively and are not using other systems for their work.

### Short Title:
Asset & Process Management
### Internal Label:
1.2

### Supporting Text:

### Outcomes
- X: The organization has identified appropriate systems to carry out its various work processes.
- X: Staff know which systems should be used to carry out their work processes.
- X: Staff only use the approved systems to carry out their work.
- X: The organization is aware of ALL the systems that are being used to carry out its work.
- X: The organization is able to quickly identify if unapproved systems start to be used.
- X: Staff at all levels are supported in initiating evaluations of systems which they have identified as "Inappropriate."
- X: TODO: The organization reevaluates the appropriateness of its systems and processes.

## 1.4
### Field Label:
Have a complete policy set describing employees' responsibilities and limitations on their facilities, hardware, and information systems use, including clearly laying out expectations for extended periods of working from home.

provide staff all of the information they might need to
- ensure that staff follow these processes effectively, and
- make the right security decision when necessary.

### Short Title:
Clear stakeholder responsibilities and limitation
### Internal Label:
1.4

### Supporting Text:


### Outcomes
- X: Staff follow approved processes to carry out their work.
- X: Staff understand their responsibilities when using systems.
- X: Staff understand their roles and responsibilities in policies and processes.
- X: Staff understand the specific risks policies and processes are mitigating.
- X: Exceptions to policies are documented and justified transparently.
- x: TODO: The organization ensures that staff with unequal personal risk levels due to their individual profiles or contexts are provided appropriate accommodations, experiencing no disadvantage in safety, performance expectations.
- X: Staff understand the scope of their decision-making authority.
- X: TODO Staff have all the information and agency they might need to safely deviate from standard processes and systems when needed to accomplish operational objectives or mitigate unacceptable risk


## 1.6
### Field Label:
The organization takes a coordinated, inclusive, and adaptive approach to managing risks.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
1.6

### Supporting Text:
Organizations that manage risks in silos often find that a decision made to reduce risk in one area quietly creates it in another, and that duplicated, disconnected controls consume resources without making anyone safer. Including the people closest to the work produces risk management that is more accurate, more trusted, and less likely to be worked around. When those affected by risk decisions are genuinely included in them, the result is a shared understanding that makes risk strategies more credible, more accurate, and more likely to be followed. A coordinated, inclusive approach produces a more accurate picture of risk, eliminates redundant controls, and keeps security from becoming an obstacle to the work it is meant to protect.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization understands and manages its risks as interconnected concerns rather than isolated problems, whether the people affected by risk decisions have genuine input into them, and whether the organization's approach to risk remains grounded in an honest and current picture of what it and the people it works with are actually willing and able to accept.

### Outcomes
- X: Risk management decisions in one area are evaluated for their potential impact on management of Broader Risks.
- X: Risk management efforts are coordinated enough across Broader Risk areas to eliminate redundant controls and processes that consume resources without reducing risk.
- X: Staff across all levels and function areas have a genuine opportunity to provide input into risk management decisions that affect their work.
- X: The organization's understanding and management of risks adapts to relevant changes in its context, activities, and threat environment.
- X: The organization does not accept risks on behalf of staff, constituents, or partners without their knowledge and agreement.
- X: The organization can accommodate different levels of individual risk tolerance without compromising the safety and security of others.
- X: Staff understand the risks behind the security practices and behaviors expected of them, and the level of risk tolerance that guides those expectations.
- X: Staff involve those responsible for managing the relevant risks before taking actions that could expose the organization or others to more risk than they have agreed to accept.


# Section 2:  Information Technology Operations that Support Security Outcomes

## 2.1
### Field Label:
Have a recurrent line item for technology in your budget that includes per-employee support for setting up and maintaining a work-from-home setup.
### Short Title:

- 1:
- 2: Technology costs are categorized and tracked. Technology decisions are only informed by cost information  include cost-data about technology are  are only evaluated at the project level
- 3:
- 4:  that includes per-employee support for setting up and maintaining a work-from-home setup
- 5: Including a special fund for extraordinary measures.


## 2.2
### Field Label:
Have regular and adequate technical support provided either by staff assigned via job description or contracted with outside agencies.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.2

### Supporting Text:
Technical support is not a luxury; it is the foundation that everything else depends on. Without reliable, knowledgeable support, systems go unprotected, staff work around problems rather than solving them, and security improvements never get off the ground. The same support that keeps day-to-day operations running is also what makes it possible to identify threats, respond to incidents, and adapt to changing conditions. How that support is provided matters less than whether it actually exists and is capable of meeting the organization's needs.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff have access to technical support that keeps them working effectively and securely, whether problems get resolved rather than recurring, and whether the people providing that support understand the organization's work and risk context well enough to protect it.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff can get help when they encounter technical problems with organizational systems.
- X: Staff technical issues are resolved within timeframes that allow work to continue effectively.
- X: Technical support responsibilities are clearly assigned and known within the organization.
- X: Systems remain operational and available when staff need them to do their work.
- X: Technical issues are resolved successfully rather than recurring or remaining unaddressed.
- X: Technology capacity supports (rather than hinders) the organization's mission and programmatic goals.
- X: Technical support providers understand the organization's work, risk context, and security requirements


## 2.3
### Field Label:
The organization maintains designated internal ownership of its technical operations.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.3

### Supporting Text:
Technical support can be sourced in many ways: dedicated staff, shared services, outside consultants, or some combination. But no arrangement works well without someone on staff who owns the results. Without designated internal ownership, vendor relationships drift, upgrades get delayed, and security initiatives stall because no one has the time or authority to drive them forward. The risk is not just operational: an organization that cannot direct and evaluate its own technical environment cannot make informed decisions about whether it is secure, well-served, or aligned with its mission.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has genuine internal ownership of its technical operations. Not just someone who handles day-to-day problems, but someone with the responsibility, time, and authority to direct providers, oversee improvements, and ensure technical systems continue to serve the organization's needs and risk management approach.

### Outcomes
- X: System upgrades and infrastructure improvements are owned and overseen internally, even when the technical work is carried out by others.
- X: External technical providers are directed and overseen by someone with designated internal responsibility, not left to operate independently.
- X: The organization maintains staff with has enough understanding of its technical environment to recognize when systems are not meeting security, operational, or mission needs.
- X: Technical decisions are aligned with the organization's broader approach to managing risk.
- X: Technical operations are informed by relevant knowledge, trends, and peer experience from the organization's sector and context.
- X: Staff at all levels are supported in initiating evaluations of systems which they have identified as "Inappropriate."

## 3.2
### Field Label:
The organization maintains oversight and control over who can access its systems and what they can do within them.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.2
### Supporting Text:
Every time someone joins or leaves the organization, the risk landscape shifts. Access that isn't granted carefully can expose systems and data to people who shouldn't have it; access that isn't removed promptly can linger long after someone has departed. The same is true when inappropriate access or behavior goes unnoticed. The organization loses the ability to put proper protections in place, understand what happened, or remediate any harm that occurred. Oversight and accountability is how an organization ensures that what people can access and do in its systems stays appropriately matched to the level of risk their staff, constituents, participants, and beneficiaries have accepted when working with them.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization maintains control over staff members data, access, and capabilities across the full arc of their relationship with it and whether it has the visibility to recognize and act on inappropriate access or behavior before it causes harm.

### Outcomes
- X: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- X: Staff who leave the organization no longer have access to organizational systems and data.
- X: Organizational data on departing staff or volunteers' devices is either transferred to the organization or securely deleted.
- X: Responsible operational staff across different functions (HR, IT, managers, security) coordinate to complete onboarding and offboarding tasks.
- X: The organization tracks completion of onboarding and offboarding tasks to ensure nothing is missed.
- X: Inappropriate accounts and access permissions are identified and addressed before they can create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff across the organization can recognize inappropriate access or accounts and know how to address it.
- X: The organization can access any data or accounts created in the course of its work, regardless of the status or cooperation of any individual staff member.
- X: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.


## 3.3
### Field Label:
Devices used to carry out organizational work are trustworthy, understood, maintained, and protected.
### Short Title:
Device Integrity
### Internal Label:
3.3
### Supporting Text:
The information that lives on and moves through organizational devices carries real risk if it is stolen, exposed, or destroyed. Managing that risk starts with devices that can be genuinely trusted, by the people who use them and the organization that depends on them. Building that trust means maintaining a clear picture of what devices are doing, keeping them current and healthy, and ensuring they are actively defended.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has the visibility, tools, and capacity to keep its devices trustworthy. This includes knowing what is installed and how things are configured, being able to identify and act on problems in a reasonable timeframe, having measures in place to protect devices; and ensuring that staff feel they can depend on their devices to safely and securely carry out their work.

### Outcomes
- X: The organization knows what software is installed on organizational devices.
- X: The organization can identify devices and software that are running outdated versions or are configured insecurely.
- X: Devices prevent installation or execution of malicious software.
- X: When devices are identified as out of date, insecure, or untrustworthy, the organization has the capacity to take action in a reasonable timeframe.
- X: Devices can be restored to a clean, known-good state when necessary.
- X: Staff provide informed consent before device security measures are installed on their devices, understanding what data will be collected and how it will be used.
- X:  The organization leverages shared resources, discounted software programs (like TechSoup), or peer networks to access legitimate copies of software and security tools affordably.

## 3.4

### Field Label:
Staff are aware of relevant security risks and practices

### Short Title:
Security Training
### Internal Label:
3.4

### Supporting Text:
Threats are constantly evolving as bad actors actively respond to changes in the context and the awareness of their tactics. Security training and awareness raising is only effective against current threats when it is relevant, current, and frequent enough to keep pace with that reality. It is only effective against emergent threats when it treats staff as capable of understanding and responding to real threats, not just following procedures.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if security training covers the systems, contexts, and threats most relevant to your staff, and whether it is designed to have the greatest overall impact.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff know how to effectively carry out all relevant security practices.
- X: Staff trained on organizational systems or processes have received relevant information about related risks and security practices.
- X: Staff understand enough about the risks security practices address to make good security decisions, even in situations their training didn't explicitly cover.
- X: Staff understand how security practices help mitigate Broader Risks facing the organization and the people it serves.
- X: Staff are prepared to identify and protect against current and emerging threats targeting organizations and groups who have similar contexts, processes, technologies, or goals.
- X: The organization's training library is enriched by materials sourced from, vetted by, or produces with its peer community.

## 3.5
### Field Label:
Agility, efficiency, and accountability are achieved by weaving security into roles and workflows, instead of being prevented by layering security on top of them, or by ignoring security all together.

### Short Title:
Access and Capability Management
### Internal Label:
3.5

### Supporting Text:

Security works best when it fits naturally into how people do their jobs, not when it creates extra steps, workarounds, or confusion. This section assesses how well your organization matches access and capabilities to the people who need them. It looks at if staff have what they need to do their work, if higher-risk information and systems are appropriately protected, and if the is being done in a way that is maintainable.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if staff can do their jobs and be secure simultaneously, whether security measures fit the actual risk context, and if staff are unlikely to not feel the need to implement workarounds or shadow IT to do their work both safely and effectively.

### Outcomes
- X: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- X: Staff have access to the internal documents and data they need to carry out their work and collaborate effectively.
- X: Higher-risk information is only accessible to staff who have a genuine need for it.
- X: Everyone with access to higher-risk information understand its sensitivity, the risks of exposure or mishandling, and how to handle it appropriately.
- X: Staff across the organization can recognize when access doesn't seem appropriate and know how to raise it.
- X: Staff recognize and respect appropriate information boundaries - knowing what not to share and not seeking what they don't need.
- X: Staff's access to systems allows them to do their job effectively, without enabling them to take actions that would create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff understand what they can do in the systems they access, the risks those actions carry, and their responsibilities in using them.
- X: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.
- X: Account structures make appropriate access and capability management straightforward, not a source of friction or overhead.

## 3.6
### Field Label:
Disaster recovery

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.6

### Supporting Text:
Have a disaster recovery plan that includes making and testing regular backups of organizational data that are stored at at least two locations. Backup drives should at a minimum be stored in a physically secure location like a locking file cabinet or safety deposit box, and ideally encrypted so that only you can access them. The storage location is especially critical for keeping backups in peoples' homes and your organization should invest in resources (safes, lock boxes, etc.) to support safe storage in personal homes.  Do not rely exclusively on third parties to back up and hold your information.

Risks to be taken into account encompass those stemming from natural hazards, neighboring entities, built environments, political or social unrest, as well as risks associated with IT and data security.

### Outcomes

Identification
- X: The organization knows what Essential Functions must be continued through a disruption, or restored as soon as possible in order to continue the critical functioning of the organization as a whole.
- X: Essential Functions include those required to address relevant safety, wellness, security, and operational risks that may arise during/after a disaster.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Essential Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization knows what Mission Critical Functions cannot be interrupted for more than a short period without significantly impacting the organizations mission.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Mission Critical Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization has an accurate understanding of what Critical Documents and Data are required to continue the critical functioning of the organization and meet its legal, regulatory, and operational obligations.
- X: The organization has the ability to recover all Critical Documents and Data after a disaster.
- X: Staff at all levels understand and have practiced their roles and responsibilities during disaster recovery.
- X: Staff at all levels understand what, if any, additional authority, agency, or flexibility they have to make decisions during disasters in order to continue to carry out Essential or Mission Critical Functions.
- X: The organization can implement essential disaster recovery processes with limited staff available, or a loss of key personnel.
