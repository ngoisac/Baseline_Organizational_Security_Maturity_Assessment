## About this assessment (what it is—and isn’t)

The NGO-ISAC Baseline Organizational Security Maturity Assessment helps you see whether your organization has the foundational capacity needed to adopt and maintain effective digital security practices.

**This is not a test and there are no wrong answers.** The value comes from an honest snapshot of your current reality—especially where practices are inconsistent, informal, or uneven across teams.

## What you’ll get from taking it (benefits to your organization)

By completing the assessment, you will receive a clearer picture of:

- A clearer view of your organization’s readiness for security improvement (what’s strong enough to build on, what will block progress).
- A way to prioritize the next few security moves for maximum impact.
- Stronger language and evidence to make the case for time, budget, and leadership support (and, where relevant, donor support).

## Why take this first version

This is an early release, and your input directly shapes the next version.**We need responses from a diverse range of members** to help us calibrate the model so results match real-world maturity.

We also need your individual input (at the end of the assessment or in follow-up interviews) to find out...

- which items are confusing or could be interpreted differently by different assessment takers.
- questions that aren't applicable for certain organization types, sizes, or operating models.
- any important baseline capacities/outcomes that are missing.
- whether the results clearly point to useful next steps (and what guidance would make them more usable)

Keep these questions in mind as you take this assessment so you can provide feedback at the end of the assessment or take part in one of our follow up interviews.

## How to answer

The survey presents a series of Outcome statements, each describing a concrete result that a security-conscious organization would consistently achieve. For each statement, you are being asked: how well does this describe what your organization actually does?

Outcomes are grouped under Maturity Objectives, which represent broader security goals. Your scores across the Outcomes within each Objective show how well your organization is achieving that goal overall.

For each Outcome statement, select the option that most honestly reflects your organization's current reality:

| Response| Meaning|
|---|---|
|I don't know|  You don’t have enough visibility to answer. (The Default)|
|I don't understand|    This Outcome Statement is confusing or unclear. |
|Never| Not currently true.|
|Rarely|    Sometimes true, but not the norm.|
|Most of the time|  Often true, but inconsistent.|
|Always |Reliably true across the organization.|

**If you are unsure, choose "I don't know."** This is encouraged, not penalized. Gaps in organizational awareness are themselves meaningful findings, and "I don't know" responses help identify areas where your organization may benefit from building better visibility or understanding.

This survey also includes an **"I don't understand"** option during this initial release. Use it to flag any Outcome statement you find confusing or unclear. This feedback will help improve the survey for future respondents.

**Use “I don’t know” freely!** Lack of visibility is itself an important finding. "I don't know" responses help identify areas where your organization may benefit from building better visibility or understanding.

In this early version you’ll also see **“I don’t understand”**; use it to flag anything unclear so we can improve it.

## Keep in Mind

- Answer for the whole organization, not just your team. Unless instructed otherwise, your responses should reflect what you believe is true across the whole organization, not just your department or role.
- Choose what’s true now, not what’s planned. An outcome your organization is working toward, but hasn't consistently achieved, is not an "Always."
- A partial, honest assessment is better than guessing. Answer what you can, use "I don't know" liberally, and note where your role limits your visibility. A partial, honest assessment is more valuable than a complete but inaccurate one.

# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

## 1.1
### Objective Title:
Staff have the technology and process knowledge they need to do their work effectively.
### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Description:
Without consistent, accessible training, even well-designed systems and processes fail in practice. Staff who never received proper training pass on incomplete knowledge, workarounds become normalized, and security practices erode not because people chose to ignore them, but because nobody showed them how to follow them correctly. Training that is outdated or pitched at the wrong level creates the same problem through a different path.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff have access to training that fits their role and skill level, stays current as systems and risks change, and builds enough real understanding that staff can make sound decisions in situations their training didn't explicitly cover, including during an actual incident.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Security Practices/Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- Incidents and Disruptions: Used together in this assessment to describe the full range of events that can interrupt or harm an organization's operations, data, staff, or constituents. A security incident typically refers to an event involving unauthorized access, data exposure, or deliberate attack. An operational disruption refers more broadly to any event — including natural disasters, infrastructure failure, or political instability — that prevents the organization from carrying out its work. Many response and recovery practices apply to both.

### Outcomes
- 1.1.1: Staff are provided training on systems, processes, and security controls they are expected to use.
- 1.1.2: Staff are provided refresher training on relevant topics.
- 1.1.3: Training materials are kept up to date with changes in the context, risk landscape, systems, and processes.
- 1.1.4: Staff are only required to train on the topics which are relevant to their current skill level or role.
- 1.1.5: Staff understand the risks that security and safety practices/controls are designed to mitigate well enough to make sound decisions in situations their training didn't explicitly cover.
- 1.1.6: The organization has evidence that staff can perform their assigned incident response and crisis management roles under realistic (simulated) conditions.

## 1.2
### Objective Title:
The organization knows what systems are in use and ensures staff work within approved boundaries.

### Short Title:
Systems & Process Management

### Internal Label:
1.2

### Description:
When staff use personal accounts or tools the organization doesn't know about, the organization loses the ability to protect the information moving through them. You cannot back up, monitor, or secure what you don't know exists. The problem is rarely deliberate, but it compounds when approved systems are unclear or when tools that once made sense are never revisited as the organization's work and risks evolve.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has identified appropriate systems for its work, whether staff know and use them, whether leadership has a complete picture of what is actually in use, and whether that picture gets updated over time.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Appropriate systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.

### Outcomes
- 1.2.1: The organization has identified appropriate systems to carry out its various work processes.
- 1.2.2: Staff know and use approved systems to carry out their work processes.
- 1.2.3: The organization is aware of ALL the software and systems that are being used to carry out its work.
- 1.2.4: The organization periodically and reactively reevaluates the appropriateness of its systems.

## 1.3
### Objective Title:
Staff understand what is expected of them, why it matters, and what to do when standard policies and processes don't cover the situation they face.
### Short Title:
Clear stakeholder responsibilities and limitation
### Internal Label:
1.3

### Description:
Standardized policies and procedures are only useful when staff understand them well enough to follow them and, when necessary, to make good decisions without them. Compliance alone creates a fragile posture: staff who don't understand the reasoning behind a rule cannot adapt when circumstances change, and policies and procedures that ignore real differences in staff risk profiles and contexts will be applied unevenly or quietly abandoned.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff understand their responsibilities and the reasoning behind them, whether they know the boundaries of their own decision-making authority, whether they can recognize when a control is doing more harm than good, and whether the organization's expectations are workable for everyone expected to meet them.

#### Terms Used
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Security Practices/Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- Appropriate systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Inappropriate systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.

### Outcomes
- 1.3.1: Staff understand what their work requires of them and why the processes and policies guiding that work exist.
- 1.3.2: Staff know when their work requires them to follow a set process, and when they can adapt how it gets done without affecting the organization's ability to manage risk.
- 1.3.3: Staff are able to identify security controls or behaviors that are inappropriate, ineffective, or create new risks.
- 1.3.4: Staff know what decisions are theirs to make, and when a situation falls outside the boundaries of their authority.
- 1.3.5: The organization ensures that staff with unequal personal risk levels due to their individual profiles or contexts are provided appropriate accommodations, experiencing no disadvantage in safety, performance expectations.


## 1.4
### Objective Title:
The organization takes a coordinated, inclusive, and adaptive approach to managing risks.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
1.4

### Description:
Organizations that manage risks in silos often find that a decision made to reduce risk in one area quietly creates it in another. But coordination alone isn't enough. Risk management that excludes the people closest to the work produces strategies that are less accurate, less trusted, and more likely to be worked around. And an approach that treats risk as a fixed, settled question will drift out of step with an organization's actual context, activities, and threat environment over time.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether risk decisions account for their effects on Broader Risks across the organization, whether staff at all levels have genuine input into decisions that affect their work, whether the organization's understanding of risk stays current as circumstances change, and whether the people affected by risk decisions, including staff, partners, and constituents, are informed and consulted rather than exposed without their knowledge.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Security Practices/Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- Broader Risks: The full range of interconnected risks facing an organization and the people it serves; spanning physical, digital, psychosocial, legal, financial, reputational, operational, and other dimensions. When used in this assessment, it signals that the risks being described extend beyond pure information security risks to risks with impacts on mission effectiveness, individual safety or wellbeing, or organizational operations.

### Outcomes
- 1.4.1: Risk management decisions in one area are evaluated for their potential impact on management of Broader Risks.
- 1.4.2: Staff understand how security practices/controls help mitigate Broader Risks facing the organization and the people it serves.
- 1.4.3: Staff across all levels and function areas have a genuine opportunity to provide input into risk management decisions that affect their work.
- 1.4.4: The organization's understanding and management of risks adapts to relevant changes in its context, activities, systems, and threat environment.
- 1.4.5: The organization does not accept risks on behalf of staff, constituents, or partners without their knowledge and agreement.
- 1.4.6: The organization can accommodate different levels of individual risk tolerance without compromising the safety and security of others.
- 1.4.7: Staff involve those responsible for managing the relevant risks before taking actions that could expose the organization or others to more risk than they have agreed to accept.


# Section 2:  Information Technology Operations that Support Security Outcomes

## 2.1
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains a recurring technology budget that reflects the real costs of keeping staff equipped and supported.
### Short Title:
Budget
### Internal Label:
2.1

### Description:
Security is not a one-time purchase. Organizations that treat technology spending as periodic rather than predictable tend to fall behind on equipment, skip necessary software, and leave staff without adequate support, sometimes pushing them onto personal devices and external systems the organization cannot secure.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization treats technology spending as a recurring, planned commitment that accounts for varied staff needs and honestly reflects what happens when resources fall short.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.

### Outcomes
- 2.1.1: The organization has a dedicated, recurring budget line item that covers technology costs including hardware, software, support, and training.
- 2.1.2: Technology budget planning accounts for the different equipment, connectivity, and support needs of staff across roles, locations, and personal circumstances.
- 2.1.3: Technology budget decisions consider the security implications of staff using personal equipment or external systems when organizational resources are insufficient.

## 2.2
### Objective Title:
Have regular and adequate technical support provided either by staff assigned via job description or contracted with outside agencies.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.2

### Description:
Good technical support keeps an organization running. When support is slow, unclear, or unassigned, staff work around problems rather than solving them, small issues grow into larger ones, and nobody is sure who is responsible when something goes wrong.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether systems stay operational when staff need them, whether issues get resolved quickly enough to avoid disrupting work, and whether responsibility for providing that support is clearly defined.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.

### Outcomes
- 2.2.1: Systems remain operational and available when staff need them to do their work.
- 2.2.2: Staff technical issues are resolved within timeframes that allow work to continue effectively.
- 2.2.3: Technical support responsibilities are clearly assigned and known within the organization.


## 2.3
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains designated internal ownership of its technical operations.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.3

### Description:
Technical support can be sourced in many ways, but no arrangement works well without someone on staff who owns the results. When that internal ownership is missing, vendor relationships drift, upgrades stall, and no one has the standing to recognize when systems are no longer working for the organization.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has designated internal ownership of its technical operations, whether staff understand the environment well enough to spot when something isn't working, and whether that oversight draws on relevant knowledge and experience from the broader sector.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Inappropriate systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.

### Outcomes
- 2.3.1: System maintenance, upgrades, and infrastructure improvements are owned and overseen by someone with designated internal responsibility, even when the technical work is carried out by others.
- 2.3.2: The organization maintains internal staff with has enough understanding of its technical environment to recognize when systems are inappropriate (not meeting security, operational, or mission needs.)
- 2.3.3: Technical operations are informed by relevant knowledge, trends, and peer experience from the organization's sector and context.

## 2.4
### Objective Title:
Organizational devices are adequate for the work, consistently maintained, and actively protected.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.4

### Description:
The devices staff use to do their work are the foundation of nearly every security protection an organization can put in place. When devices are too old or under-powered to run current software, staff find workarounds that create new risks. When devices are not consistently maintained, the protections that depend on them quietly erode. Both problems tend to be uneven: organizations that provision devices based on seniority rather than need, or that don't account for the real conditions of remote or field-based staff, end up with security that holds for some people but not others. That unevenness is itself a risk.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether all staff have devices capable of supporting their work and the security requirements that come with it, whether the organization knows when devices fall short and can act on that knowledge in a reasonable timeframe, and whether device decisions reflect the real working conditions of everyone in the organization.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.

### Outcomes
- 2.4.1: The organization knows when devices or software are out of date or insecurely configured.
- 2.4.2: All staff have devices with sufficient processing power, storage, and compatibility to run current operating systems, security software, and the tools required for their work.
- 2.4.3: Device provisioning decisions are based on functional and security requirements, applied consistently across all staff regardless of role, seniority, or merit.
- 2.4.4: Device provisioning reflects the real working conditions of all staff, including the risks created by remote work, inadequate equipment, and personal device use.
- 2.4.5: Staff provide informed consent before device security measures are installed on their devices, with a clear understanding of what data will be collected and how it will be used.
- 2.4.6: When devices are identified as out of date, insecure, or untrustworthy, the underlying issues are addressed or the device is replaced within a reasonable timeframe.
- 2.4.7: Devices prevent installation or execution of malicious software.
- 2.4.8: Devices can be restored to a clean, known-good state when necessary.

# Section 3:  Digital Security Baseline Capacities

## 3.1
### Objective Title:
Security controls are purposeful, practical, and kept current, so they reduce real risk without becoming obstacles to the work.
### Short Title:
Security Practices/Controls
### Internal Label:
3.1
### Description:
Security measures that are poorly chosen, blindly copied from elsewhere, or never revisited tend to create one of two problems: controls so burdensome they get ignored, or controls that consume real resources without meaningfully reducing risk. Both leave an organization less secure than it thinks it is. Controls that staff cannot explain, follow, or see the purpose of are controls that will not hold, and controls that don't account for how staff actually work will be quietly set aside by those they don't fit.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization's controls are grounded in its actual threats and operational realities, whether they are documented and understood well enough to be applied consistently, whether staff have workable alternatives when standard approaches don't fit their circumstances, and whether the organization learns from and contributes to the experience of peers facing similar constraints.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Security Practices/Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- Appropriate systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Inappropriate systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.

### Outcomes

- 3.1.1: Security controls account for the operational realities of how staff work (travel, remote locations, limited connectivity, shared devices).
- 3.1.2: Security controls are selected based on identified threats and risks specific to the organization's context, rather than adopted from generic checklists or industry defaults.
- 3.1.3: Security controls that do not clearly reduce risk in a practical, understood way are removed or simplified.
- 3.1.4: Security controls and the reasoning behind them are documented in a way that allows staff to understand, apply, and maintain them.
- 3.1.5: Staff at all levels are supported to identify and adopt appropriate alternative controls when standard security controls are inappropriate for their workflow, context, or risk profile.
- 3.1.6: The organization develops security controls and configurations collaboratively with peer organizations facing similar operational contexts, systems, threats, or resource constraints.
- 3.1.7: The organization shares its security configurations, policies, and implementation guidance with peer organizations that could benefit from them.

## 3.2
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains oversight and control over who can access its systems and what they can do within them.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.2
### Description:
Every time someone joins, changes roles, or leaves the organization, the risk landscape shifts. Access that isn't granted carefully can expose systems to people who shouldn't have it; access that isn't removed promptly can linger long after someone has departed. Without visibility into who has access and what they are doing with it, the organization cannot recognize when something has gone wrong or understand what happened after the fact.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization maintains control over who can access its systems and data across the full arc of a staff member's relationship with it, whether inappropriate access is identified and addressed before it causes harm, and whether the organization retains both the access it needs to its own accounts and data and the ability to trace actions back to the individuals who took them.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Appropriate systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Inappropriate systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.

### Outcomes
- 3.2.1: New staff receive the accounts and access they need to begin work in a timely manner.
- 3.2.2: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- 3.2.3: Inappropriate accounts are identified and addressed before they can create unnecessary risk.
- 3.2.4: Staff who leave the organization no longer have access to organizational systems and data.
- 3.2.5: The organization can access any data or accounts created in the course of its work, regardless of the status or cooperation of any individual staff member.
- 3.2.6: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.

## 3.3
### Objective Title:
Agility, efficiency, and accountability are achieved by weaving security into roles and workflows, instead of being prevented by layering security on top of them, or by ignoring security all together.

### Short Title:
Access and Capability Management
### Internal Label:
3.3

### Description:
Security works best when it fits naturally into how people do their jobs. When it doesn't, staff find workarounds, and the organization ends up with a security posture it only thinks it has. The same risk runs in the other direction: access and capabilities that are too broad, too narrow, or too complicated to manage create unnecessary exposure or friction that slows work down.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff can do their jobs effectively without enabling actions that create unnecessary risk, whether they have access to what they need and respect appropriate boundaries around what they don't, and whether account structures make that balance straightforward to maintain over time.

#### Terms Used
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes physical devices (laptops, phones, tablets), software on those devices, hosted and online services, third-party applications, etc.
- Appropriate systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Inappropriate systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes (including security controls) are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.

### Outcomes
- 3.3.1: Staff's access to systems allows them to do their job effectively, without enabling them to take actions that would create unnecessary risk.
- 3.3.2: Staff have access to the internal documents and data they need to carry out their work and collaborate effectively.
- 3.3.3: Staff recognize and respect appropriate information boundaries - knowing what not to share and not seeking what they don't need.
- 3.3.4: Account structures make managing access and capability straightforward, not a source of friction or overhead.

## 3.4
### Objective Title:
The organization can identify disruptions quickly, limit their spread, and protect the people affected.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.4

### Description:
Disruptions arrive without warning, and the organizations that handle them well are almost never the ones that figured out their response on the fly. Whether the trigger is a ransomware attack, a data breach, a flood, or political unrest, the same pattern plays out when no plan exists: critical time is lost establishing who is responsible, who has authority to act, and what needs to happen first, while the situation continues to unfold. A response plan does not need to be elaborate to be effective, but it does need to exist before it is needed, be understood by the people expected to carry it out, and account for the full range of people who may be affected, not just the organization's systems.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization is genuinely prepared to recognize and contain disruptions before they compound. This includes whether staff know their roles and have clear authority to act, whether planning extends beyond operational systems to the broader harms that incidents can create for staff, constituents, and partners, and whether the organization has identified where it will turn for outside support when its own capacity is not enough.

#### Terms Used
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Broader Risks: The full range of interconnected risks facing an organization and the people it serves; spanning physical, digital, psychosocial, legal, financial, reputational, operational, and other dimensions. When used in this assessment, it signals that the risks being described extend beyond pure information security risks to risks with impacts on mission effectiveness, individual safety or wellbeing, or organizational operations.
- Incidents and Disruptions: Used together in this assessment to describe the full range of events that can interrupt or harm an organization's operations, data, staff, or constituents. A security incident typically refers to an event involving unauthorized access, data exposure, or deliberate attack. An operational disruption refers more broadly to any event — including natural disasters, infrastructure failure, or political instability — that prevents the organization from carrying out its work. Many response and recovery practices apply to both.

### Outcomes
- 3.4.1: The organization can recognize when a security incident or operational disruption is occurring or has occurred.
- 3.4.2: When an incident or disruption occurs, the organization acts promptly to contain it and protect essential functions, preventing further spread or impact.
- 3.4.3: Staff understand their roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority during incidents and disruptions, including any additional authority they have when standard processes cannot be followed.
- 3.4.4: Response planning accounts for how incidents and disruptions may create or compound Broader Risks for staff, constituents, and partners, including those with differing risk profiles.
- 3.4.5: The organization has identified external resources (security organizations, consultants, peer networks, CERTs) they can reach out to for support during incidents or operational disruptions.

## 3.5
### Objective Title:
The organization can restore critical functions and data after a disruption and meet its obligations to everyone affected.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.5

### Description:
Containing a disruption and recovering from one are different challenges, and organizations that conflate them often find themselves surprised by the second. Containment stops the immediate harm; recovery is the harder, slower work of restoring what matters and fulfilling obligations to everyone affected. Organizations that haven't thought carefully about what they cannot afford to lose before a disruption occurs are forced to make those decisions under pressure, with incomplete information, and sometimes with reduced staff. The result is not just a slower recovery but one that is more likely to miss something critical, whether that is a legal obligation, a vulnerable constituent, or a function that was quietly holding other things together.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has a clear and practiced understanding of its most critical functions and data, and whether it has the capacity to restore them under difficult conditions. This includes whether recovery planning accounts for the full range of harms a disruption can cause, not just operational ones; whether the people and communities the organization works with are kept informed; and whether the organization is connected to a broader network of peers it can learn from and contribute to before, during, and after a crisis.

#### Terms Used
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Security Practices/Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- Critical Functions: The activities, processes, and data the organization has determined it cannot afford to lose, pause, or be denied access to without serious harm to its mission, its staff, or the people it serves.
- Incidents and Disruptions: Used together in this assessment to describe the full range of events that can interrupt or harm an organization's operations, data, staff, or constituents. A security incident typically refers to an event involving unauthorized access, data exposure, or deliberate attack. An operational disruption refers more broadly to any event — including natural disasters, infrastructure failure, or political instability — that prevents the organization from carrying out its work. Many response and recovery practices apply to both.

### Outcomes
