## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across three categories: 1) cultural hallmarks of security success, 2) information technology operations that support security outcomes, 3) digital security baseline capacities. Go through each section one by one.

## Terms used in this survey
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes devices, software, hosted solutions, third-party hosted solutions, etc.
- Processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- Security Practices OR Security Controls: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- "Inappropriate" systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.”
- "Appropriate" systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Broader Risks: The full range of interconnected risks facing an organization and the people it serves; spanning physical, digital, psychosocial, legal, financial, reputational, operational, and other dimensions. When used in this assessment, it signals that the risks being described extend beyond pure information security risks to risks with impacts on mission effectiveness, individual safety or wellbeing, or organizational operations.

# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

## 1.1
### Objective Title:
Staff have the technology and process knowledge they need to do their work effectively.
### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Description:
New tools, updated processes, and changes to how work gets done all require staff to learn something new. Without consistent, accessible training, even well-designed systems and processes fail in practice because the people using them are left to figure things out on their own. The problem compounds over time: staff who never received proper training pass on incomplete knowledge to others, workarounds become normalized, and security practices erode not because people chose to ignore them but because nobody ever showed them how to follow them correctly.

Security training and awareness raising is only effective against current threats when it is relevant, current, and frequent enough to keep pace with that reality. It is only effective against emergent threats when it treats staff as capable of understanding and responding to real threats, not just following procedures.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff have access to the training they need to use organizational systems and follow organizational processes effectively and securely, whether that training stays current and relevant as things change, and whether it is designed to meet staff where they are rather than applying a single approach to everyone.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff are provided training on systems, processes, and security controls they are expected to use.
- X: Staff are provided refresher training on relevant topics.
- X: Training materials are kept up to date with changes in the context, risk landscape, systems, and processes.
- X: Staff are only required to train on the topics which are relevant to their current skill level or role.
- X: Staff understand what they can do in the systems they access, the risks those actions carry, and their responsibilities in using them.
- X: Staff understand the risks that security and safety processes and controls are designed to mitigate well enough to make sound decisions in situations their training didn't explicitly cover.
- X: Staff understand how security practices help mitigate Broader Risks facing the organization and the people it serves.
- X: Staff at all levels can identify security controls or behaviors that are inappropriate, ineffective, or creating new risks.
- X: The organization has evidence that staff can perform their assigned incident response and crisis management roles under realistic (simulated) conditions.

## 1.2
### Objective Title:
The organization knows what systems are in use and ensures staff work within approved boundaries.

### Short Title:
Asset & Process Management

### Internal Label:
1.2

### Description:
When staff use personal accounts, unofficial tools, or systems the organization doesn't know about, the organization loses the ability to protect the information moving through them. Security depends on visibility: you cannot back up, monitor, or secure what you don't know exists. The problem is rarely deliberate; staff turn to familiar personal tools when approved ones are unclear, unavailable, or not communicated. The result is a fragmented environment where information is scattered across systems the organization cannot access, administer, or protect.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has a clear, communicated set of approved systems for its work, whether staff know and follow them, and whether the organization maintains enough visibility into how its information is being managed to catch it quickly when something falls outside those boundaries.

### Outcomes
- X: The organization has identified appropriate systems to carry out its various work processes.
- X: Staff know which systems should be used to carry out their work processes.
- X: Staff only use the approved systems to carry out their work.
- X: The organization is aware of ALL the software and systems that are being used to carry out its work.
- X: The organization is able to quickly identify if unapproved software or systems start to be used.
- X: The organization periodically and reactively reevaluates the appropriateness of its systems.

## 1.4
### Objective Title:
Staff understand what is expected of them, why it matters, and what to do when standard policies and processes don't cover the situation they face.
### Short Title:
Clear stakeholder responsibilities and limitation
### Internal Label:
1.4

### Description:
Policies are only useful when staff understand them well enough to follow them and, when necessary, to make good decisions without them. An organization that relies on compliance alone creates a fragile security posture: staff who don't understand the reasoning behind a policy cannot adapt when circumstances change, and those who face situations their training didn't cover have no basis for making the right call. At the same time, policies that don't account for the real differences in staff circumstances, contexts, and risk profiles will be applied unevenly or quietly ignored by those they don't fit.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff understand their responsibilities, the risks those responsibilities are designed to address, and the boundaries of their decision-making authority, and whether the organization's policies and processes are flexible and equitable enough to work for everyone expected to follow them.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff follow approved processes to carry out their work.
- X: Staff understand their responsibilities when using systems.
- X: Staff understand their roles and responsibilities in policies and processes.
- X: Exceptions to policies are documented and justified transparently.
- x: The organization ensures that staff with unequal personal risk levels due to their individual profiles or contexts are provided appropriate accommodations, experiencing no disadvantage in safety, performance expectations.
- X: Staff understand the scope of their decision-making authority.


## 1.6
### Objective Title:
The organization takes a coordinated, inclusive, and adaptive approach to managing risks.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
1.6

### Description:
Organizations that manage risks in silos often find that a decision made to reduce risk in one area quietly creates it in another, and that duplicated, disconnected controls consume resources without making anyone safer. Including the people closest to the work produces risk management that is more accurate, more trusted, and less likely to be worked around. When those affected by risk decisions are genuinely included in them, the result is a shared understanding that makes risk strategies more credible, more accurate, and more likely to be followed. A coordinated, inclusive approach produces a more accurate picture of risk, eliminates redundant controls, and keeps security from becoming an obstacle to the work it is meant to protect.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization understands and manages its risks as interconnected concerns rather than isolated problems, whether the people affected by risk decisions have genuine input into them, and whether the organization's approach to risk remains grounded in an honest and current picture of what it and the people it works with are actually willing and able to accept.

### Outcomes
- X: Risk management decisions in one area are evaluated for their potential impact on management of Broader Risks.
- X: Staff across all levels and function areas have a genuine opportunity to provide input into risk management decisions that affect their work.
- X: The organization's understanding and management of risks adapts to relevant changes in its context, activities, and threat environment.
- X: The organization does not accept risks on behalf of staff, constituents, or partners without their knowledge and agreement.
- X: The organization can accommodate different levels of individual risk tolerance without compromising the safety and security of others.
- X: Staff involve those responsible for managing the relevant risks before taking actions that could expose the organization or others to more risk than they have agreed to accept.


# Section 2:  Information Technology Operations that Support Security Outcomes

## 2.1
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains a recurring technology budget that reflects the real costs of keeping staff equipped and supported.
### Short Title:
Budget
### Internal Label:
2.1

### Description:
Security is not a one-time purchase. It requires sustained investment in equipment, software, and support to remain effective as technology ages, threats evolve, and organizations change. Organizations that treat technology spending as a periodic, one-off expense rather than a predictable operational cost tend to fall behind on device replacement, skip necessary software, and leave staff without adequate support. The result is not just outdated tools but a security posture that quietly erodes over time.

Outcomes in this section aim to show that the organization treats technology spending as a recurring, planned commitment rather than an afterthought.

### Outcomes
- X: The organization has a dedicated, recurring budget line item that covers technology costs including hardware, software, support, and training.
- X: Technology budget planning accounts for the different equipment, connectivity, and support needs of staff across roles, locations, and personal circumstances.
- X: Technology budget decisions consider the security implications of staff using personal equipment or connections when organizational resources are insufficient.

## 2.2
### Objective Title:
Have regular and adequate technical support provided either by staff assigned via job description or contracted with outside agencies.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.2

### Description:
Technical support is not a luxury; it is the foundation that everything else depends on. Without reliable, knowledgeable support, systems go unprotected, staff work around problems rather than solving them, and security improvements never get off the ground. The same support that keeps day-to-day operations running is also what makes it possible to identify threats, respond to incidents, and adapt to changing conditions. How that support is provided matters less than whether it actually exists and is capable of meeting the organization's needs.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether staff have access to technical support that keeps them working effectively and securely, whether problems get resolved rather than recurring, and whether the people providing that support understand the organization's work and risk context well enough to protect it.

### Outcomes
- X: Systems remain operational and available when staff need them to do their work.
- X: Staff technical issues are resolved within timeframes that allow work to continue effectively.
- X: Technical support responsibilities are clearly assigned and known within the organization.


## 2.3
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains designated internal ownership of its technical operations.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.3

### Description:
Technical support can be sourced in many ways: dedicated staff, shared services, outside consultants, or some combination. But no arrangement works well without someone on staff who owns the results. Without designated internal ownership, vendor relationships drift, upgrades get delayed, and security initiatives stall because no one has the time or authority to drive them forward. The risk is not just operational: an organization that cannot direct and evaluate its own technical environment cannot make informed decisions about whether it is secure, well-served, or aligned with its mission.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has genuine internal ownership of its technical operations. Not just someone who handles day-to-day problems, but someone with the responsibility, time, and authority to direct providers, oversee improvements, and ensure technical systems continue to serve the organization's needs and risk management approach.

### Outcomes
- X: System maintenance, upgrades, and infrastructure improvements are owned and overseen by someone with designated internal responsibility, even when the technical work is carried out by others.
- X: The organization maintains internal staff with has enough understanding of its technical environment to recognize when systems are not meeting security, operational, or mission needs.
- X: Technical operations are informed by relevant knowledge, trends, and peer experience from the organization's sector and context.

## 2.4
### Objective Title:
All staff have access to adequately powered, regularly updated devices that can support their work and the security requirements that come with it.
### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
2.4

### Description:
The computers your staff use are the foundation of nearly every security control your organization can put in place. The software used to carry out and secure your day to day work all require processing power to function, and when devices are too old or underpowered to run them reliably, staff will find workarounds that create new risks. Organizations that underinvest in device replacement often discover that security tools meant to protect them become obstacles instead, and that the informal solutions staff adopt in response quietly undermine the controls the organization thought it had. Devices that are adequate for some staff but not others, or that are allocated based on seniority rather than need, create uneven security across the organization.

Outcomes in this section aim to show that all staff have devices capable of supporting their work and the security requirements that come with it. This includes whether devices can run current software and receive security updates, whether the organization has enough visibility and authority to act when devices fall short, and whether provisioning decisions account for the full range of people and circumstances across the organization.

### Outcomes
- X: All staff have access to computers that can run the systems and software required for their work
- X: Staff computers have sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to handle work tasks without significant performance issues
- X: Staff devices are capable of running current versions of operating systems and security software
- X: Determinations about device provisioning are made to address security and/or function-driven requirements, not as a reward for an individuals seniority, tenure, or merit.
- X: Staff devices receive regular security updates and patches from the manufacturer or operating system vendor
- X: Technical operations staff have the authority and resources to replace devices that create unacceptable security or operational risks
- X: Device provisioning decisions consider how device security intersects with physical security (especially for remote workers), operational continuity, and staff safety.
- X: Senior leadership demonstrates compliance with the same policies that apply to all staff.
- X: Device security considerations include the risks created by staff using personal devices or workarounds they put in place when organizational devices are inadequate

# Section 3:  Digital Security Baseline Capacities

## 3.0
### Objective Title:
Security controls are purposeful, practical, and kept current, so they reduce real risk without becoming obstacles to the work.
### Short Title:
Security Controls and Practices
### Internal Label:
3.0
### Description:
Security measures that are poorly chosen, blindly copied from elsewhere, or never revisited tend to create one of two problems: controls so burdensome they get ignored, or controls that consume real resources without meaningfully reducing risk. Both leave an organization less secure than it thinks it is. Controls that staff cannot explain, cannot follow, or do not see the purpose of are controls that will not hold.

Outcomes in this section aim to show that the organization's security controls are well-matched to its actual risks and the realities of how its people work. This includes whether controls are proportionate, documented, and understood; whether staff have genuine options when standard approaches do not fit their circumstances; and whether the organization draws on and contributes to the broader security community rather than working in isolation.

### Outcomes

- X: Security controls account for the operational realities of how staff work (travel, remote locations, limited connectivity, shared devices).
- X: Security controls are selected based on identified threats and risks specific to the organization's context, rather than adopted from generic checklists or industry defaults.
- X: Security controls that do not clearly reduce risk in a practical, understood way are removed or simplified.
- X: Security controls and the reasoning behind them are documented in a way that allows staff to understand, apply, and maintain them.
- X: Staff at all levels are supported to identify and adopt appropriate alternative controls when standard security controls are inappropriate for their workflow, context, or risk profile.
- X:  The organization develops security controls and configurations collaboratively with peer organizations facing similar operational contexts, systems, threats, or resource constraints.
- X: The organization shares its security configurations, policies, and implementation guidance with peer organizations that could benefit from them.

## 3.1
### Objective Title:
The organization is prepared to recognize, contain, and recover from security incidents while protecting everyone affected.

### Short Title:
incident response planning
### Internal Label:
3.1
### Description:
Every organization faces security risks that cannot be fully prevented. The question is not whether something will go wrong, but whether your organization will be ready when it does. Without a plan in place before an incident occurs, teams waste critical time figuring out who is responsible, how to reach technical support, and what steps to take first, while the situation continues to unfold. An incident response plan does not need to be elaborate to be effective; even a basic, well-communicated plan dramatically improves an organization's ability to contain damage, restore operations, and protect the people affected.

Outcomes in this section aim to show that your organization has the foundational readiness to recognize, respond to, and recover from security incidents. This includes whether staff know their roles before an incident happens, whether the organization can limit harm when one occurs, and whether planning accounts for the full range of people, inside and outside the organization, who may be affected.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff understand their individual roles and responsibilities during a security incident.
- X: The organization can identify when a security incident is occurring or has occurred.
- X: When security incidents occur, their impact is mitigated and normal operations are restored within defined timeframes.
- X: When security incidents occur, the incident is contained so it does not spread beyond the initially affected systems, accounts, or locations.
- X: The organization exchanges incident information and mitigations with constituents, partners, and peers to prevent or prepare for similar attacks.
- X: The organization has identified external resources (security organizations, consultants, peer networks, CERTs) they can reach out to for incident support.
- X: Incident response planning considers how information security incidents may create or interact with Broader Risks.
- X: Incident response plans consider how incidents may disproportionately impact staff, constituents, or partners with different profiles (gender, location, role, technical capacity, personal circumstances).
- X: Staff, constituents, partners, and beneficiaries are informed when incidents may affect their data, privacy, safety, or wellbeing.


## 3.2
### Objective Title:
The organization maintains oversight and control over who can access its systems and what they can do within them.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.2
### Description:
Every time someone joins or leaves the organization, the risk landscape shifts. Access that isn't granted carefully can expose systems and data to people who shouldn't have it; access that isn't removed promptly can linger long after someone has departed. The same is true when inappropriate access or behavior goes unnoticed. The organization loses the ability to put proper protections in place, understand what happened, or remediate any harm that occurred. Oversight and accountability is how an organization ensures that what people can access and do in its systems stays appropriately matched to the level of risk their staff, constituents, participants, and beneficiaries have accepted when working with them.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization maintains control over staff members data, access, and capabilities across the full arc of their relationship with it and whether it has the visibility to recognize and act on inappropriate access or behavior before it causes harm.

### Outcomes
- X: New staff receive the accounts and access they need to begin work in a timely manner.
- X: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- X: Inappropriate access or accounts are identified and addressed before they can create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff who leave the organization no longer have access to organizational systems and data.
- X: The organization can access any data or accounts created in the course of its work, regardless of the status or cooperation of any individual staff member.
- X: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.

## 3.3
### Objective Title:
Devices used to carry out organizational work are trustworthy, understood, maintained, and protected.
### Short Title:
Device Integrity
### Internal Label:
3.3
### Description:
The information that lives on and moves through organizational devices carries real risk if it is stolen, exposed, or destroyed. Managing that risk starts with devices that can be genuinely trusted, by the people who use them and the organization that depends on them. Building that trust means maintaining a clear picture of what devices are doing, keeping them current and healthy, and ensuring they are actively defended.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has the visibility, tools, and capacity to keep its devices trustworthy. This includes knowing what is installed and how things are configured, being able to identify and act on problems in a reasonable timeframe, having measures in place to protect devices; and ensuring that staff feel they can depend on their devices to safely and securely carry out their work.

### Outcomes
- X: The organization can identify devices and software that are running outdated versions or are configured insecurely.
- X: Devices prevent installation or execution of malicious software.
- X: When devices are identified as out of date, insecure, or untrustworthy, the organization has the capacity to take action in a reasonable timeframe.
- X: Devices can be restored to a clean, known-good state when necessary.
- X: Staff provide informed consent before device security measures are installed on their devices, understanding what data will be collected and how it will be used.
- X: The organization leverages shared resources, discounted software programs (like TechSoup), or peer networks to access legitimate copies of software and security tools affordably.

## 3.5
### Objective Title:
Agility, efficiency, and accountability are achieved by weaving security into roles and workflows, instead of being prevented by layering security on top of them, or by ignoring security all together.

### Short Title:
Access and Capability Management
### Internal Label:
3.5

### Description:
Security works best when it fits naturally into how people do their jobs, not when it creates extra steps, workarounds, or confusion. This section assesses how well your organization matches access and capabilities to the people who need them. It looks at if staff have what they need to do their work, if higher-risk information and systems are appropriately protected, and if the is being done in a way that is maintainable.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if staff can do their jobs and be secure simultaneously, whether security measures fit the actual risk context, and if staff are unlikely to not feel the need to implement workarounds or shadow IT to do their work both safely and effectively.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff's access to systems allows them to do their job effectively, without enabling them to take actions that would create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff have access to the internal documents and data they need to carry out their work and collaborate effectively.
- X: Staff recognize and respect appropriate information boundaries - knowing what not to share and not seeking what they don't need.
- X: Account structures make managing access and capability straightforward, not a source of friction or overhead.

## 3.6
### Objective Title:
The organization is prepared to sustain and recover its essential functions and data through a disaster.

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.6

### Description:
Disasters take many forms: a ransomware attack, a flood, political unrest, or the sudden loss of key technology vendors. What they have in common is that they arrive without warning and test whether the organization has thought carefully enough about what it cannot afford to lose or stop doing. Organizations that wait until a disaster occurs to figure this out face compounding consequences: not only are they dealing with the immediate disruption, they are making critical decisions under pressure without a clear picture of what matters most or who is authorized to act. The organizations that recover well are those that understood their priorities before anything went wrong.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has a clear and practiced understanding of the functions, data, and processes it cannot afford to lose, whether it has the capacity to continue or restore them under difficult conditions including reduced staffing, and whether the people responsible for carrying that work forward know what is expected of them and have the authority to act.


### Outcomes
- X: The organization knows what Essential Functions must be continued through a disruption, or restored as soon as possible in order to continue the critical functioning of the organization as a whole.
- X: Essential Functions include those required to address relevant safety, wellness, security, and operational risks that may arise during/after a disaster.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Essential Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization knows what Mission Critical Functions cannot be interrupted for more than a short period without significantly impacting the organizations mission.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Mission Critical Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization has an accurate understanding of what Critical Documents and Data are required to continue the critical functioning of the organization and meet its legal, regulatory, and operational obligations.
- X: The organization has the ability to recover all Critical Documents and Data after a disaster.
- X: Staff at all levels understand what, if any, additional authority, agency, or flexibility they have to make decisions during disasters in order to continue to carry out Essential or Mission Critical Functions.
- X: The organization can implement essential disaster recovery processes with limited staff available, or a loss of key personnel.
