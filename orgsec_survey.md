## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across four categories: cultural hallmarks of security success, information technology operations that support security outcomes, digital security baseline capacities, and best practices for safe working from home. Go through each section one by one.

For each item, you should grade your organization honestly on a scale from 1 to 5. At the end of the survey you will receive an email that includes your score and how to interpret it.


## Terms used in this survey
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes devices, software, hosted solutions, third-party hosted solutions, etc.
- processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- security practices: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- "Inappropriate" systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.”
- "Appropriate" systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.
- Broader Risks: The full range of interconnected risks facing an organization and the people it serves; spanning physical, digital, psychosocial, legal, financial, reputational, operational, and other dimensions. When used in this assessment, it signals that the risks being described extend beyond pure information security risks to risks with impacts on mission effectiveness, individual safety or wellbeing, or organizational operations.

# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

#### TODO
- Training materials include... (written guidance, FAQ's, step-by-step guides, recorded webinars, online tutorials, etc.)
- Training includes proactive in-person sessions, webinars, one-on-one guidance, structured shadowing. (Reactive support/assistance is covered under 2.3 technical operations)

## 1.1
### Field Label:
Staff have the technology and security knowledge they need to do their work safely and effectively.
### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Supporting Text:
New tools and practices, and changes to standard operating procedures, demand end-user training. If your organization doesn't have established practices around training--when new people are hired, when refresher training is needed, and when important processes change--implementing improved and possibly complex secure practices is nearly impossible. Beginning with documentation and training for new hires is a wise first step in this area. Following up with new employees at 30-day intervals will ensure they continue to get the support they need to do their work effectively and securely. When a new process is introduced, it is like everyone in your organization is new to it, so initial training with similar follow-up is recommended.


### Outcomes
- X: Staff are provided training on systems and processes they are expected to use.
- X: Staff are provided refresher training on relevant topics.
- X: Staff are only required to train on the topics which are relevant to their current skill level or role.

## 3.3
### Field Label:
Devices used to carry out organizational work are trustworthy, understood, maintained, and protected.
### Short Title:
Device Integrity
### Internal Label:
3.3
### Supporting Text:
The information that lives on and moves through organizational devices carries real risk if it is stolen, exposed, or destroyed. Managing that risk starts with devices that can be genuinely trusted, by the people who use them and the organization that depends on them. Building that trust means maintaining a clear picture of what devices are doing, keeping them current and healthy, and ensuring they are actively defended.

Outcomes in this section aim to show whether the organization has the visibility, tools, and capacity to keep its devices trustworthy. This includes knowing what is installed and how things are configured, being able to identify and act on problems in a reasonable timeframe, having measures in place to protect devices; and ensuring that staff feel they can depend on their devices to safely and securely carry out their work.

### Outcomes
- X: The organization knows what software is installed on organizational devices.
- X: The organization can identify devices and software that are running outdated versions or are configured insecurely.
- X: Devices prevent installation or execution of malicious software.
- X: When devices are identified as out of date, insecure, or untrustworthy, the organization has the capacity to take action in a reasonable timeframe.
- X: Devices can be restored to a clean, known-good state when necessary.
- X: Staff provide informed consent before device security measures are installed on their devices, understanding what data will be collected and how it will be used.
- X:  The organization leverages shared resources, discounted software programs (like TechSoup), or peer networks to access legitimate copies of software and security tools affordably.

## 3.4

### Field Label:
Staff are aware of relevant security risks and practices

### Short Title:
Security Training
### Internal Label:
3.4

### Supporting Text:
Threats are constantly evolving as bad actors actively respond to changes in the context and the awareness of their tactics. Security training and awareness raising is only effective against current threats when it is relevant, current, and frequent enough to keep pace with that reality. It is only effective against emergent threats when it treats staff as capable of understanding and responding to real threats, not just following procedures.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if security training covers the systems, contexts, and threats most relevant to your staff, and whether it is designed to have the greatest overall impact.

### Outcomes
- X: Staff know how to effectively carry out all relevant security practices.
- X: Staff trained on organizational systems or processes have received relevant information about related risks and security practices.
- X: Staff understand enough about the risks security practices address to make good security decisions, even in situations their training didn't explicitly cover.
- X: Staff understand how security practices help mitigate Broader Risks facing the organization and the people it serves.
- X: Staff are prepared to identify and protect against current and emerging threats targeting organizations and groups who have similar contexts, processes, technologies, or goals.
- X: The organization's training library is enriched by materials sourced from, vetted by, or produces with its peer community.

## 3.5
### Field Label:
Agility, efficiency, and accountability are achieved by weaving security into roles and workflows, instead of being prevented by layering security on top of them, or by ignoring security all together.

### Short Title:
Access and Capability Management
### Internal Label:
3.5

### Supporting Text:

Security works best when it fits naturally into how people do their jobs, not when it creates extra steps, workarounds, or confusion. This section assesses how well your organization matches access and capabilities to the people who need them. It looks at if staff have what they need to do their work, if higher-risk information and systems are appropriately protected, and if the is being done in a way that is maintainable.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if staff can do their jobs and be secure simultaneously, whether security measures fit the actual risk context, and if staff are unlikely to not feel the need to implement workarounds or shadow IT to do their work both safely and effectively.

### Outcomes
- X: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- X: Staff have access to the internal documents and data they need to carry out their work and collaborate effectively.
- X: Higher-risk information is only accessible to staff who have a genuine need for it.
- X: Everyone with access to higher-risk information understand its sensitivity, the risks of exposure or mishandling, and how to handle it appropriately.
- X: Staff across the organization can recognize when access doesn't seem appropriate and know how to raise it.
- X: Staff recognize and respect appropriate information boundaries - knowing what not to share and not seeking what they don't need.
- X: Staff's access to systems allows them to do their job effectively, without enabling them to take actions that would create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff understand what they can do in the systems they access, the risks those actions carry, and their responsibilities in using them.
- X: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.
- X: Account structures make appropriate access and capability management straightforward, not a source of friction or overhead.

## 3.6
### Field Label:
Disaster recovery

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.6

### Supporting Text:
Have a disaster recovery plan that includes making and testing regular backups of organizational data that are stored at at least two locations. Backup drives should at a minimum be stored in a physically secure location like a locking file cabinet or safety deposit box, and ideally encrypted so that only you can access them. The storage location is especially critical for keeping backups in peoples' homes and your organization should invest in resources (safes, lock boxes, etc.) to support safe storage in personal homes.  Do not rely exclusively on third parties to back up and hold your information.

Risks to be taken into account encompass those stemming from natural hazards, neighboring entities, built environments, political or social unrest, as well as risks associated with IT and data security.

### Outcomes

Identification
- X: The organization knows what Essential Functions must be continued through a disruption, or restored as soon as possible in order to continue the critical functioning of the organization as a whole.
- X: Essential Functions include those required to address relevant safety, wellness, security, and operational risks that may arise during/after a disaster.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Essential Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization knows what Mission Critical Functions cannot be interrupted for more than a short period without significantly impacting the organizations mission.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Mission Critical Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization has an accurate understanding of what Critical Documents and Data are required to continue the critical functioning of the organization and meet its legal, regulatory, and operational obligations.
- X: The organization has the ability to recover all Critical Documents and Data after a disaster.
- X: Staff at all levels understand and have practiced their roles and responsibilities during disaster recovery.
- X: Staff at all levels understand what, if any, additional authority, agency, or flexibility they have to make decisions during disasters in order to continue to carry out Essential or Mission Critical Functions.
- X: The organization can implement essential disaster recovery processes with limited staff available, or a loss of key personnel.
