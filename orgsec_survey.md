## Introduction

This assessment tool is meant to help organizations identify where their most critical security needs lie. Many common information systems and technology practices are oriented around providing or supporting security outcomes. Because of that, organizations that have foundational technology capacity issues are best served by putting energy improving baseline systems before taking on new security initiatives.

The tool is laid out as a number of items to assess broken out across four categories: cultural hallmarks of security success, information technology operations that support security outcomes, digital security baseline capacities, and best practices for safe working from home. Go through each section one by one.

For each item, you should grade your organization honestly on a scale from 1 to 5. At the end of the survey you will receive an email that includes your score and how to interpret it.


## Terms used in this survey
- Systems: This refers to any technologies/tools, systems, or online services which are used to carry out work. This includes devices, software, hosted solutions, third-party hosted solutions, etc.
- processes: This is the way your work is done. This includes any standard operating procedures, specific workflows, security practices, etc.
- security practices: these are any processes that are specifically used to mitigate security risks. (i.e. Use of security tools like two-factor or password managers, data collection/minimization standards, secure communications protocols, etc.)
- "Inappropriate" systems or processes: Inappropriate systems or processes are those that create unacceptable obstacles to efficient, secure operations, have excessive costs, or has unacceptable impacts on risk management efforts.”
- "Appropriate" systems or processes: Appropriate systems or processes are those that the organization has identified as allowing it to safety and effectively carry out the organizations work.

# Section 1: Cultural Hallmarks for Security Success

## 1.1
### Field Label:
Staff have the technology and security knowledge they need to do their work safely and effectively.

### Short Title:
training and learning
### Internal Label:
1.1

### Supporting Text:

New tools and practices, and changes to standard operating procedures, demand end-user training. If your organization doesn't have established practices around training--when new people are hired, when refresher training is needed, and when important processes change--implementing improved and possibly complex secure practices is nearly impossible. Beginning with documentation and training for new hires is a wise first step in this area. Following up with new employees at 30-day intervals will ensure they continue to get the support they need to do their work effectively and securely. When a new process is introduced, it is like everyone in your organization is new to it, so initial training with similar follow-up is recommended.

#### TODO
- Training materials include... (written guidance, FAQ's, step-by-step guides, recorded webinars, online tutorials, etc.)
- Training includes proactive in-person sessions, webinars, one-on-one guidance, structured shadowing. (Reactive support/assistance is covered under 2.3 technical operations)

### Outcomes
- X: Staff are offered training on systems and processes they are expected to use.
- X: Staff are offered refresher training on relevant topics.
- X: Staff are offered training on security practices.
- X: Training material on systems and processes integrate the relevant security topics for those areas.
- X: Staff are only required to train on the topics which are relevant to their current skill level or role.
- X: Training materials are available in multiple formats so staff can learn in a way that works best for them.
- X: Training materials are kept up to date with changes in the context, actors, systems, and processes.
- X: Staff at all levels provide feedback which is used to refine training efforts to be more effective.

### Short Title:
Access and Capability Management
### Internal Label:
3.5

### Supporting Text:

Security works best when it fits naturally into how people do their jobs, not when it creates extra steps, workarounds, or confusion. This section assesses how well your organization matches access and capabilities to the people who need them. It looks at if staff have what they need to do their work, if higher-risk information and systems are appropriately protected, and if the is being done in a way that is maintainable.

Outcomes in this section aim to show if staff can simultaneously do their jobs and be secure simultaneously, whether security measures fit the actual risk context, and whether workarounds or shadow IT are symptoms of poor integration.

This includes minimizing or eliminating the use of shared accounts where more than one person, especially less-vetted parties like volunteers, can log in to your systems using the same credentials.

### Outcomes
- X: Only authorized users, services, and hardware have access to our systems and information.
- X: Staff have access to the internal documents and data they need to carry out their work and collaborate effectively.
- X: Higher-risk information is only accessible to staff who have a genuine need for it.
- X: Everyone with access to higher-risk information understand its sensitivity, the risks of exposure or mishandling, and how to handle it appropriately.
- X: Staff across the organization can recognize when access doesn't seem appropriate and know how to raise it.
- X: Staff recognize and respect appropriate information boundaries - knowing what not to share and not seeking what they don't need.
- X: Staff's access to systems allows them to do their job effectively, without enabling them to take actions that would create unnecessary risk.
- X: Staff understand what they can do in the systems they access, the risks those actions carry, and their responsibilities in using them.
- X: When individual accountability is required, actions taken in relevant systems can be traced to the specific staff member who performed them.
- X: Account structures make appropriate access and capability management straightforward, not a source of friction or overhead.

## 3.6
### Field Label:
Disaster recovery

### Short Title:
### Internal Label:
3.6

### Supporting Text:
Have a disaster recovery plan that includes making and testing regular backups of organizational data that are stored at at least two locations. Backup drives should at a minimum be stored in a physically secure location like a locking file cabinet or safety deposit box, and ideally encrypted so that only you can access them. The storage location is especially critical for keeping backups in peoples' homes and your organization should invest in resources (safes, lock boxes, etc.) to support safe storage in personal homes.  Do not rely exclusively on third parties to back up and hold your information.

Risks to be taken into account encompass those stemming from natural hazards, neighboring entities, built environments, political or social unrest, as well as risks associated with IT and data security.

### Outcomes

Identification
- X: The organization knows what Essential Functions must be continued through a disruption, or restored as soon as possible in order to continue the critical functioning of the organization as a whole.
- X: Essential Functions include those required to address relevant safety, wellness, security, and operational risks that may arise during/after a disaster.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Essential Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization knows what Mission Critical Functions cannot be interrupted for more than a short period without significantly impacting the organizations mission.
- X: The organization has the ability to continue and/or restore Mission Critical Functions during disasters.
- X: The organization has an accurate understanding of what Critical Documents and Data are required to continue the critical functioning of the organization and meet its legal, regulatory, and operational obligations.
- X: The organization has the ability to recover all Critical Documents and Data after a disaster.
- X: Staff at all levels understand and have practiced their roles and responsibilities during disaster recovery.
- X: Staff at all levels understand what, if any, additional authority, agency, or flexibility they have to make decisions during disasters in order to continue to carry out Essential or Mission Critical Functions.
- X: The organization can implement essential disaster recovery processes with limited staff available, or a loss of key personnel.
